    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Story</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Meal Prep Codex was built in <strong>2025</strong> as a <strong>solo project</strong> to explore <strong>Django, APIs, and Web Scraping</strong>. It started as a way to learn modern web development while solving a real-world problem: making high-quality recipes available for free, without clutter or unnecessary paywalls.

      <li><strong>Fast & Free Recipes</strong>: No subscriptions, no sign-upsâ€”just recipes, instantly available.</li>
      <li><strong>API for Developers</strong>: We provide a structured API with a large collection of recipes, so others can integrate it into their own applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Original Content</strong>: While we aggregate some well-known recipes, we also focus on providing unique and original dishes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Technology Behind the Project</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This platform is built using <strong>Django</strong> as the backend framework, leveraging <strong>APIs and Web Scraping</strong> to gather and serve a wide variety of recipes. The goal was to learn how to build a robust and scalable web application while providing something valuable to the community.
